# machine-learning-project

Objective: 
  --) Compare Living Wage data and other factors to determine their impact on a county/state’s crime rate. 
  --) We’ll train a machine learning model using features like 
    -- living wage, 
    -- minimum wage, 
    -- cost of goods, and 
    -- local costs of an area. 
  --) After our model has a high enough accuracy score, we’ll predict how changes among the different features (ie. increase in insurance costs, decrease in minimum wage) may impact different crime rates (as well as crime overall).

Data sources: Living wage data, FBI crime Data, & any other sources that fit

Methodology: ETL data sources, train into whichever model best explains trends, analyze changes in crime from projecting new scenarios
